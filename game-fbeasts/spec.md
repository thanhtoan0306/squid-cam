Game Specification: "Thôn Phệ Dị Biên" (Gameplay Analysis)
1. Game Overview
Genre: Top-Down Arena Survivor / Bullet Heaven (similar to Vampire Survivors).
Theme: Wuxia / Xianxia (Chinese Martial Arts Fantasy).
Core Objective: The player controls a single powerful hero and must survive against increasingly large and difficult waves of enemies. The player's main role is positioning, as attacks are mostly automatic.
Core Loop: Survive -> Defeat Enemies -> Collect Resources (XP/Gold) -> Level Up & Upgrade -> Survive Longer.
2. Game Objects Specification
This section details the individual components observed in the gameplay.
2.1. Player Characters (Heroes)
Multiple playable heroes are shown, each with a unique appearance and attack set.
Hero 1: The Lotus Mage (Female)
Appearance: A female character in a pink and purple dress with long, dark hair.
Primary Attack (Seen at 0:16):
Type: Rapid-Fire Projectile Stream.
Visuals: Shoots a continuous, fast stream of small, bright pink, circular energy bolts. They have a slight glow and a very faint trail.
Behavior: Seems to be a basic, high-frequency attack that automatically targets the nearest enemies.
Special Attack 1 (Seen at 0:01, 0:24):
Type: Massive Area of Effect (AoE) Burst.
Visuals: Creates a large, screen-filling explosion of pink lotus flower graphics. These flowers bloom and then fade, dealing huge damage numbers (e.g., 999999).
Behavior: A periodic, high-damage "ultimate" ability that likely targets a boss or a large cluster of enemies. It appears to be an instant-cast effect, not a projectile.
Special Attack 2 (Seen at 0:00, 0:23):
Type: Melee Cleave.
Visuals: The character performs a quick spin, creating a swirling purple crescent-shaped slash effect around her.
Behavior: A close-range defensive or offensive attack that hits all enemies in a small radius.
Hero 2: The Water Dragon (Male)
Appearance: A male character with blue/gold armor and spiky dark hair.
Primary Attack (Seen at 0:04):
Type: Continuous Cone AoE.
Visuals: Unleashes a constant, cone-shaped torrent of light-blue, sharp, water or ice-like particles. The effect is dense and persistent.
Behavior: This is a "channeled" attack that continuously damages all enemies within the cone. It appears to have pierce, meaning it hits every enemy in its path without stopping.
Hero 3: The Fire God (Male, "Lü Bu")
Appearance: A male character in a red and black outfit with long, flowing red hair and a distinctive headpiece (resembling the historical figure Lü Bu).
Primary Attack (Seen at 0:09):
Type: Continuous Cone AoE.
Visuals: Functionally identical to the Water Dragon's attack but with fire aesthetics. It's a cone of bright orange, red, and yellow fire/ember particles.
Behavior: Channeled cone attack with pierce. It likely also applies a Damage over Time (DoT) "burn" effect, a common mechanic for fire attacks.
2.2. Enemy Units
Standard Enemy: "Minions"
Appearance: Several variations are shown. The most common are small, stylized panda-like figures in red shirts. Others look like generic armored soldiers.
Behavior:
Spawn in large groups from the edges of the screen.
Move directly towards the player character in a straight line.
They are purely melee units; their only attack is to collide with the player.
Have low health and are easily defeated in large numbers.
They do not have visible health bars, likely to reduce screen clutter.
Elite / Boss Enemy
Appearance: A large, red, demonic-looking humanoid figure. Significantly larger than standard minions, with a distinct silhouette and visible armor.
Behavior:
Appears to be a high-priority target.
Moves towards the player like other enemies but is likely much tougher.
Has a visible health bar above its head (red background with a green overlay that depletes).
Likely has higher damage, health, and may grant a greater reward upon defeat.
2.3. Projectiles, Effects, and Pickups
Damage Numbers:
Visuals: White text with a red/black outline (e.g., -666). They pop up from the enemy that was hit.
Behavior: Float upwards and fade out after a short duration. The size and color of the number may indicate critical hits (the massive 999999 is a prime example).
Experience Gems (Inferred):
Visuals: Small, blue, diamond-shaped gems that drop from defeated enemies.
Behavior: These are the primary resource for in-run progression. When collected, they fill an experience bar. When the bar is full, the player levels up. They likely have a "magnet" effect, being automatically pulled to the player when they get close.
Gold Coins (Inferred):
Visuals: Small, yellow, circular coins that drop from enemies or chests.
Behavior: This is the primary resource for meta-progression (permanent upgrades made outside of a gameplay run).
3. UI (User Interface) & Game Systems
Currency Display (Top Right): An icon of a gold coin followed by a number (25400). This tracks the player's collected Gold.
Enemy Health Bar: A standard green-on-red bar displayed only above high-value targets (Bosses/Elites).
Level-Up / Upgrade System (Critically Important Observation at 0:08):
A card with a character portrait (呂布 - Lü Bu) and name pops up mid-game.
This confirms a roguelite upgrade system. When the player levels up (by collecting enough blue gems), the game pauses and presents them with a choice of new weapons, passive boosts, or upgrades to existing abilities. This is the core of player choice and build diversity in this genre.
4. Audio Specification
Sound Effects (SFX): Each attack has a distinct sound.
Pink Bolts: High-pitched "pew-pew" or energy zap sounds.
Lotus Nova: A loud, booming/magical explosion sound.
Water/Fire Stream: A continuous "whooshing" or "crackling" sound.
Impacts: Audible hit sounds when projectiles connect with enemies.
Pickups: A satisfying "ding" or "cha-ching" sound when collecting gems or gold.
Voice Lines: Characters shout their attack names or battle cries in Mandarin. This adds significant personality and impact to the abilities.
Example at 0:10: "神挡杀神, 佛挡杀佛" ("If a god blocks me, I'll kill the god; if a Buddha blocks me, I'll kill the Buddha.")
